I am a musically inclined individual with proficiency in playing various instruments, showcasing my talent on both various percussion instruments and the piano. I was part of the renowned Delshodegan Ensemble, a prominent folk music group in Iran, where my role involved being a percussion artist. We performed concerts across various cities in Iran, including Tehran, Mashhad, Tabriz, and more. Some of our compositions have been published on platforms like Spotify, making them accessible to a wider audience. You can explore and enjoy our music by following the provided links below.
