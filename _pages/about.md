Hi! I'm Amin Bigdeli, a PhD student at the [David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), supervised by [Dr.Charles Clarke](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/about/people/claclark) and [Dr. Ebrahim Bagheri](https://www.torontomu.ca/electrical-computer-biomedical/people/faculty/ebrahim-bagheri/). My passion lies in doing research in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing.

Previously, I earned my Master's degree at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) under the guidance of [Dr. Ebrahim Bagheri](https://www.torontomu.ca/electrical-computer-biomedical/people/faculty/ebrahim-bagheri/) and [Dr. Morteza Zihayat](https://www.torontomu.ca/information-technology-management/faculty-research/morteza-zihayat/). During this time, I focused on Responsible Information Retrieval Systems and delved into research on Gender Fairness within information retrieval systems. I'm proud to have received the Best Master's Thesis Award from the [Canadian Artificial Intelligence Association](https://www.caiac.ca/en/best-msc-award), recognizing excellence in a thesis completed at a Canadian University in the field of Artificial Intelligence. You can find my Master's Thesis [here](https://www.caiac.ca/sites/default/files/publications/Thesis_Amin_Bigdeli.pdf).
